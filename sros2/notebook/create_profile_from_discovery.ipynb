    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demontrates procedurally provisioning access control policies for ROS2, as well as basic verification methods for evaluating transport compliance with respect to the symbolic profile description. This is done through the use of two new developing frameworks:\n",
    "* [ComArmor](https://github.com/ComArmor):  a profile configuration language for defining Mandatory Access Control (MAC) policies for communication graphs.\n",
    "* [Keymint](https://github.com/keymint): a workspace build tool for compiling cryptographic artifacts used in securing middleware systems like ROS, DDS, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we extract a topological representation of the example ROS application we’d like to secure by learning from demonstration, i.e. via logging DDS discovery data published at runtime to then generate a minimal satisfactory policy in ComArmor. Keymint is then used generate the necessary transport artifacts that encompass the ComArmor policy. To verify the secure transport complies with the original policy at runtime, basic exhaustive test analysis is performed by exploring all possible subject and object exchanges. We then compare the test results from the transport analysis with the original symbolic graph learned to determine the false positive and negative instances in the policy’s enforcement.\n",
    "\n",
    "For repeating and reproducing our experimental results, this notebook has also been made available in its complete form. The experimental procedure presented additionally exemplifies a typical workflow using ComArmor and Keymint."
